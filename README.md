What is included
----------------

At the moment you can use basic and combined expressions, but options for sin, tan or sqrt
are also planned to be added as buttons.

One of my main goals was to use the keyboard to controll the application. So almost full
keyboard input is supported.


What is to be done
------------------

- Full keyboard support - currently shortcuts for breakets doesn't work.
- Buttons for more complicated functions
- Perhaps design polishing?!


How to compile
--------------

You could create a native package for your platform by executing:
```bash
mvn jfx:native
```

This will create a nativa package for your platform
